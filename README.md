## NFL Data Visualization Sandbox

Sandbox for me to test out idea for clustering on ppg vs ypg for NFL teams by season.

Would like to build a visualization in plotly (jupyter-notebook) of NFL teams by PPG-YPG graphs by season (filter by season)


## TODO
- Fix tema name hover bug (plotly `hover_name` param)
- Add in some other clustering examples
- Could we build a simple classification model for win prediction?
